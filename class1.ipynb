    "You can think of a project as a discrete unit of work, \n",
    "such as a chapter of a thesis/dissertation, analysis for a manuscript, or a monthly report. \n",
    "We recommend organizing your code, data, and other associated files as projects, \n",

    "- Navigate to the location in your computer where you'd like to save files for this class (we recommend Desktop or Documents).\n",
    "- Click \"New\" in the upper right hand corner of the screen, then \"Folder\". This will create a new folder named \"Untitled Folder\".\n",
    "- Click the box next to \"Untitled Folder\", then select \"Rename\" near the upper left corner of the screen. Name the new directory \"intro_python\"; we'll now refer to this as your project directory.\n",
    "- Click on the new folder to view its contents (it should be empty).\n",
    "- Click \"New\" in upper right hand corner of the window, then select \"Python3\". This creates a new ipython notebook file and opens it in a new tab. Click on the title of the notebook to rename the file \"class1\". If you click on the browser tab for the file browser, you can also rename as for the folder earlier.
